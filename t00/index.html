    <h2 id="C1">What makes a superhero?</h2>
    <p> <b>A superhero or uperheroine is a stock character that possesses abilities beyond those of ordinary people,</b> who typically uses his or her powers to help the world become a better place, or is dedicated to protecting the public, and fighting crime. Superhero fiction is the genre of fiction that is centered on such characters, especially in American comic books since the 1930s (and later Hollywood films), as well as in Japanese media (including kamishibai, tokusatsu, manga, anime, and video games) since the 1930s.</p>
    <p>Some superheroes use their powers to help fight daily crime while also combating threats against humanity from supervillains, who are their criminal counterparts.<b>Often at least one of these supervillains will be the superhero's archenemy. Some popular supervillains become recurring characters in their own right and long-running superheroes and superheroines such as Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Spider-Man, Captain America, and Iron Man have a rogues gallery of many such villains.</b> </p>

    <p>Thor</p>
    <p>Thor Odinson is the Asgardian God of Thunder, the former king of Asgard and New Asgard, and a founding member of the Avengers. When his irresponsible and impetuous behavior reignited a conflict between Asgard and Jotunheim, Thor was denied the right to become king, stripped of his power, and banished to Earth by Odin. While exiled on Earth, Thor learned humility, finding love with Jane Foster, and helped save his new friends from the Destroyer sent by Loki. Due to his selfless act of sacrifice, Thor redeemed himself in his father's eyes and was granted his power once more, which he then used to defeat Loki's schemes of genocide.</p>
